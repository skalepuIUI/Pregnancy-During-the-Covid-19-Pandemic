## 🔍 Overview

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   Loads raw CSV data using Pandas and inspects initial structure and metadata.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handles inconsistent or invalid entries  
   - Detects and removes irrelevant columns  
   - Standardizes formats

3. **Null-Value & Outlier Analysis**  
   - Identifies columns with missing values  
   - Visualizes null distributions  
   - Considers removal or imputation strategies

4. **Exploratory Preparation**  
   - Converts data types (dates, categories)  
   - Introduces placeholder transformations for future EDA
